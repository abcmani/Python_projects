small and automation projects

# Inserts_2_testing.py : 
After writing code for a new functionality and UT in our project before the deadline., tried to do a small performance test
on the new functionality., for that we need many entries in one of the table so that each entry will invoke the functioanlity once.
I created one insert statement manually for the unit testing(UT)., and i am not ready to do the manual & repetitive work for several insert statements.
So i wrote a small automation code which generates insert statements with random data.

# guess_game.py:
Just a number guessing game created for passing the boring time., 
so simply this program memorizes some number everytime within a range., and you just have to guess it in a few chances.
Really had some fun while playing it.
